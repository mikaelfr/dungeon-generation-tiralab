# Weekly report for week 3
## This week's progress
Approx. time spent: 15h

Most of the time this week was spent on debugging, writing more tests and setting up rendering. 

This week I spent some time looking for a good UI solution, lightweight, simple to use for drawing very simple things. I settled on simple2d and set that up. While I was at that, I also cleaned up the CI config, separating tasks into separate jobs.

## What I learned this week?
I learned a bit about building external libraries in a CI environment. Don't really remember learning anything else this week.

## Problems? 
It's pretty hard to find good sources on Delaunay triangulation, other than one paper which just has straight up C++ source code. Guess I gotta rely on Wikipedia.

It's also quite hard to write anything worthwhile about extending tests and setting up UI.

## Next up?
Next week I'll try to take the generation part as far as possible. Hopefully I'll be able to spend more time this weekend working on the project. I should also probably make the generation actually work in headless mode.
