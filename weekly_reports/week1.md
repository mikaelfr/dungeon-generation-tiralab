# Weekly report for week 1
## This week's progress
Finished planning and wrote project specification. No code written as of yet.

## What I learned
I got a better understanding of the underlying algorithms behind premade functions I use on the daily.

## Next up
Start writing basic structure of the code. Try to get basic data structures and helper classes (e.g. rng) up and running with working tests.
