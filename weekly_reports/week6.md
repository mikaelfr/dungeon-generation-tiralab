# Weekly report for week 6
## This week's progress
Approx. time spent: <5h

Didn't really get much done this week. I did get the confirmation that the complexity of my generation algorithm is sufficient for the course. I also started working on patching up missing documentation.

## Things to do before final deadline

I've still got a bit of work to do before the final deadline. Firstly, I managed to expertly dodge all mentions of testing and implementation documentation in the weekly schedule. So that's something I have to work on in the upcoming two weeks.

I'm also a very strong advocate for the true agile software development. Basically, don't comment the code at all and then when you look at the code a week later you have no idea what on earth could possibly be going on there. So yeah, adding Javadoc style comments to each and every function and class is definitely in order.

I should also extend tests a bit while writing the test documentation. Especially Generator class is in need of proper testing. If possible, testing the performance somehow would also be great. Also, taking some of the hard coded values, parameterizing them and testing different values is something I could do if I happen to find time somewhere.

Finally, I have some small code fixes and improvements in mind. Last week's code review raised a few valid issues I need to get around to checking/fixing. There's also a few *TODO* comments still scattered around the code base, those need looking at. 

Time for the final stretch...
